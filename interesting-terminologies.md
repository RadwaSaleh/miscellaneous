Dark Release/Launch: A concept that means releasing your features to production to a subset of users. 

**Goals/Benefits:** 
> Less risk as only a selected number of users are seeing the feature. We usually start with a small percentage of users and then gradually rolling it out to more users if everything is ok or roll back if there's a problem.
> Flexibile way to run experiments and release the winning variation to all users.
