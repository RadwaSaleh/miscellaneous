There are different Grant Types/flows to gain access token in OAuth 2.0, the most common flows are:

Authorization Code
Client Credentials (Client Id and Client Secret)
Password (Resource Owner Password)

Authorization Code

- I hate this flow so much
![auth-code-flow]()
- I have used it in: Postman, Cypress(javascript) and RestAssured(Java)
- Using Postman is easy pease if you have the required information
import [this request](https://github.com/RadwaSaleh/miscellaneous/blob/main/postman-oauth2-keycloak.postman_collection.json) in postman to check the needed fields
